# Hi! I'm Veronica✨

I'm passionate about Frontend development, but especially I'm in love with React!

Working as HR specialist and participating in It-related projects I realized that my passion is web development. 
Web development attracts me with the opportunity to influence the visual component of web applications. 
I find it essential to create not only more convenient, but also intuitive user interfaces.

* I've been practicing frontend development for past 6 months after putting in 850 hours of studying;
* Resolving 2-3 katas on codewars **daily**;
* turned my Notion account into React encyclopedia
