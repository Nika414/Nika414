# Hi! I'm Veronica✨

I'm passionate about Frontend development, but especially I'm in love with React!

I first thought about web development, participating in It-related projects as HR. 
First of all, web-development attracts me with the opportunity to influence the visual component of web applications. 
I find it essential to create not only more convenient, but also intuitive user interfaces.

* spent approx. 850 hours on studying and practicing frontend development over past 6 months
* solve at least 2-3 katas on codewars **every day**
* turned my Notion account into React encyclopedia
